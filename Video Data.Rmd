Prep libraries and import datasheets

### Bar Graphs ###
```{r}

Having the one 'moulting' bar is really ugly and hard to interpret, maybe should go back and re-watch, classify as either pre, post or unkown. I remeber that vid and it is weird


```{r}
# Moults over the full experiment
moult_tally <- video_events %>%
  filter(event_type == "Moult") %>%   
  group_by(day_number, camera, time_of_day) %>%
  summarise(count = n(), .groups = "drop")

ggplot(moult_tally, aes(x = day_number, y = count)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge") +
  labs(
    title = "Moults by Day",
    x = "Day",
    y = "Moults",
    color = "Camera Number"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```

Fucking about with boxplots
```{r}

moult_count <- video_events %>%
  filter(event_type == "Moult") %>%
  group_by(camera, time_of_day) %>%
  summarize(count = n(), .groups = "drop")

ggplot(moult_count, aes(x = time_of_day , y = count, )) +
  geom_boxplot()

```
