Prep libraries and import datasheets
```{r}
library(tidyverse)

video_events <- read_csv("video Notable Events.csv")
video_morts <- read_csv("Mort Counts for Vid Analysis.csv")
no_event_vids <- read_csv("No Event Videos.csv")
video_times <- read_csv("Video Start and Stop Times.csv")
```

Play around
```{r}
#create bar chart showing notable events in both AM and PM
video_events %>%
  group_by(event_type, time_of_day) %>%
  summarize(count = n()) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = event_type, y = count, fill = time_of_day)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
  labs(title = "Notable Events by Time of Day",
       x = "Event",
       y = "Count") +
  theme_minimal()
